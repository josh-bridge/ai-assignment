\section{Introduction}

\section{AI classifiers}
  % • A brief description / introduction to decision trees

  % • A detailed description of decision tree parameters (individual research required) and how they might affect the performance of the classifier

  % • A brief description / introduction to artificial neural networks

  % • A detailed description of artificial neural network parameters (individual research required) and how they might affect the performance of the classifier

\section{Data set analysis}
  % • Description of the data set attributes (e.g.):
  %   (a) Distribution,
  %   (b) predictive, (individual research required)
  %   (c) Outliers,
  %   (d) Attribute measurement scales e.g. nominal, ratio etc.

\section{Classifier Prediction}
  % • Based on the evidence from sections 2 and 3, what are the strengths and weaknesses of a decision tree when applied to the dataset

  % • Based on the evidence from sections 2 and 3, what are the strengths and weaknesses of an artificial neural network when applied to the dataset

  % • Prediction: which classifier is likely to be best for the dataset (before you have done any experiments) Individual research required for this section.

\section{Initial Experiments}
  % Strategy for missing attribute values. Justified with evidence/argument

  % • Strategy for outliers, justified with evidence/argument

  % • Reported results for experiments to develop / test initial strategies (Individual student judgement to be used on how far to go with each type of classifier in experiments leave plenty of time for real experiments later)

\section{Main Experiments}
  % • Plan for DT experiments, with justification

  %   (a) Execution of DT experiments to find DT with highest Classification Accuracy

  %   (b) Execution of DT experiments to find the most highly pruned DT that does not have a significantly lower Classification Accuracy than the tree with best CA.

  % • Plan for artificial neural network experiments, with justification

  %   (a) Execution of artificial neural network experiments to find artificial neural network with highest classi- fication accuracy using a single layer of neurons

  %   (b) Execution of artificial neural network experiments to find artificial neural network with highest classi- fication accuracy using a multiple layers of neurons (Individual student judgement to be used on how many layers to be used).


\section{Advanced Pre-processing}
  % • Experiments with different methods of pre-processing the data (scaling, grouping, conversion etc.). This work could contribute marks for work reaching the 86%+ mark band). The section may be omitted if you do not anticipate reaching such a mark.

\section{Conclusions}
  % • A description of the best (pruned) decision tree for the dataset (including number of nodes, leaves, pruning parameters etc.).

  % • A diagram of the best pruned decision tree for the dataset.

  % • A description of the best artificial neural network for the dataset (numbers of neurons, layers etc.)

  % • A summary table of best classifiers

  % • A diagram of the best artificial neural network for the dataset.

  % • A statement of which performed best and therefore which you would recommend to the client to solve the task

  % • Short analysis or discussion of results
